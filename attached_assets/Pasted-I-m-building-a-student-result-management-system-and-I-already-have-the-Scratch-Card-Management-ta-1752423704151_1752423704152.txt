Iâ€™m building a student result management system, and I already have the "Scratch Card Management" tab set up inside the dashboard â€” donâ€™t move or recreate it elsewhere. Please help me implement the full functionality there, and also fix some issues on the result-checking and printing page.

ðŸ“Œ Scratch Card Management Tab (Inside Dashboard Only):
Show a table of all generated scratch cards with:

Serial Number

Masked PIN (e.g., last 4 digits only)

Status: unused, used, expired

Expiry Date

Bound Student ID (if already used)

Created Date

Actions: Delete, Deactivate, Regenerate

Add a "Generate Cards" button/form with:

Number of cards to generate

Duration (must be at least 3 months)

Automatically generate secure, unique serials and PINs

PIN Usage Rules:

When a student uses a PIN to check results, store their student ID with that card

After that, only that same student can reuse the PIN until it expires

If any other student tries to use it, block access and show an appropriate message

Automatically mark PINs as expired when the expiry date is passed.

Create a settings section on this tab to allow the admin to:

Set the default duration (minimum 3 months)

Toggle auto-expiration logic

Security:

PINs should be securely stored (hashed or encrypted)

ðŸ§¾ Result Page (Public Page for Students to Check Results):
Fix the issue where "N/A" appears when printing results

Make sure all student details are properly retrieved and displayed (name, ID, class, etc.)

Ensure all dynamic data used during result view is passed correctly to the print layout

Add a fallback message if data is missing instead of just showing "N/A"

Ensure the PIN and Serial Number entered:

Are valid and match

Have not expired

Belong to the student using it (after first use)

Mark the PIN as used if not already

ðŸ§© Notes:
Use the existing page layout and tech stack (do not create new pages unnecessarily).

Follow existing styling.

Match how other parts of the dashboard function and are styled.
